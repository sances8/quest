            <li>6 Don't forget your friend in your soul, and don't forget him in your estate.</li>
            <li>7 Every counselor praises his own counsel, but every counselor advises in his own favor.</li>
            <li>8 Guard thy soul from the counselor, and know beforehand what he needs. For it may be that he advises for himself.</li>
